I was in Tel Aviv a few weeks ago with IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson for a workshop and meetup with the Israeli developer community. Israel has a long and glowing history with blockchain technology: zero-knowledge proofs were co-invented by an Israeli-American computer scientist, and the region is home to several innovative blockchain projects already. It seemed only natural that we should meet and engage with this vibrant community of developers to discuss the future of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and the powerful potential of smart contracts. The first part of the event was a technical workshop covering [Plutus](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/plutus/ "Plutus documentation, testnet.iohkdev.io") and [Marlowe](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/marlowe/ "Marlowe documentation, testnet.iohkdev.io"), IOHKâ€™s smart contract platforms, including talks from several members of the IOHK team: Manuel Chakravarty, language architect, Lars BrÃ¼njes, director of education, Polina Vinogradova, a formal methods software engineer, and Alexander Nemish, a functional compilers engineer. The morning began with some theory about the design and implementation of IOHKâ€™s smart contract approach, and after lunch it was time for a hands-on workshop and Q&A.

The attendees themselves were from a range of backgrounds, with developers, businesspeople, and blockchain enthusiasts in the mix. Weâ€™ve had lots of positive feedback since the event with one attendee, a crypto enthusiast and early adopter, describing it as â€˜an impressive and informative event that was organized with a lot of respect for the local crypto-developers community.â€™

It was a busy day, and the evening saw us transition straight into a broader industry-wide meetup with almost a hundred attendees. Special guests from local blockchain companies were in attendance, including the CEO of Tel Aviv-based blockchain company [COTI](https://coti.io/ "COTI website, https://coti.io/"), Shahaf Bar-Geffen, as well as guests from [Algoz](https://algoz.io/ "Algoz website, https://algoz.io/") and [Endor](https://www.endor.com/ "Endor website, https://www.endor.com/"). After Charlesâ€™ keynote about current Cardano developments, there were panel discussions about business in a smart contract-driven economy and how blockchain innovations are set to put Israel at the forefront of that market.

Iâ€™ve wanted to run an IOHK event in Israel for a long time, and it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the hard work of IOHKâ€™s head of events Kerry de Jong and her team, as well as our partners for the event [MarketAcross](https://marketacross.com/ "MarketAcross website, https://marketacross.com/"). Israel is an area full of talent and potential, and Iâ€™m pleased to be able to say that weâ€™ve finally taken our first steps to get involved with the Israeli developer community. Iâ€™m looking forward to having more meetups in the country, and hope that IOHK will one day have a continuous presence there to make the most of this innovative, blossoming region.
