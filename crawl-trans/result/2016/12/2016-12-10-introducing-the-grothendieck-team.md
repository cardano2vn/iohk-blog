## [**The Grothendieck Team**](/en/projects/ethereum-classic/#team)
Hi everyone, it's my pleasure to officially announce the new team known as The Grothendieck Team! The team has been named after Alexander Grothendieck, a German-born French mathematician who became a leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. They have been committed to Ethereum Classic by [IOHK](/en/) in order to build a Scala client for ETC based on IOHK's [Scorex framework](/en/projects/scorex/). Plans are in place to bring the team on "Let's Talk ETC!" to discuss the roadmap and development timeframe for ETC in 2017 (after they have properly reviewed the ETC documentation). Links to the IOHK website, Scorex page, Let's Talk ETC! youtube channel and ETC blog are posted below.

Ethereum Classic Developer Team Grothendieck/ScalaC

Iâ€™ve been developing in Scala since 2012 for a number of commercial clients. Having started my adventure with programming at the age of 13 this was a natural choice of a career path. However Iâ€™ve always had a fondness for abstract and pure ideas which is why Iâ€™m especially keen on working in a field so heavily reliant on mathematics. Outside of work I actively enjoy various sports, especially cycling and fitness as well as those for the mind like chess and - my latest passion - cue sports.
