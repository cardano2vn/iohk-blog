On a frosty Friday morning in Switzerlandâ€™s commercial centre of Zurich, an audience arrived early at the university to learn about the emerging field of smart contracts in a presentation given by Charles Hoskinson. A completely new way of quantifying concepts like trust, reputation and ambiguity, smart contracts are a digital legal system â€“ a computer protocol that facilitates, verifies or enforces the negotiation or performance of a contract.

The idea is now gaining new momentum from ventures including [Cardano](/en/projects/cardano/), and academic papers are also providing a driving force behind the development. These contracts arenâ€™t written in legalese, but in computer code, and that gives them the flexibility to quickly adapt to societyâ€™s needs in a way legislation cannot.

![](img/2017-01-20-smart-contracts-will-use-code-to-reshape-law.009.jpeg) Charles outlined the five elements needed for smart contracts:
## **1. A secure distributed systemâ€¨**
Who gets to design the protocol is an important question. Useful resources are offered in work by Tim Swanson, who has written a lot about private/public blockchains. [Rich Hickeyâ€™s lecture, the Value of Values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM), is worth watching on YouTube.â€¨
## **2. A language in which to write the contractsâ€¨**
Cardanoâ€™s researchers have conceived Plutus to write its smart contracts. Creating a language is the easy part, but the question of how you deal with ambiguity must be addressed; who would you go to if there is a problem?â€¨
## **3. A secure way of performing computationâ€¨**
[â€œVerifiable computingâ€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing) is the concept to explore here. There is a debate about hardware versus software â€“ how can you be sure the system has had no backdoor installed?â€¨
## **4. A method of representing assets and valueâ€¨**
This could be done by creating a token that is pegged to a value-stable currency such as the dollar. Another matter to consider is what jurisdiction the digital asset falls under.â€¨
## **5. Trustworthy data feedsâ€¨**
In traditional finance this might be supplied by a Bloomberg terminal. A smart contract needs a similar source, but there is no equivalent yet in this field to provide the necessary information stream.â€¨

This reimagining of how legal processes can work has the potential to solve some problems of current legal systems, offering a clarity of code in place of ambiguous legal clauses. If needed, a layer can be added to the protocol to allow for human judgement and arbitration. This all combines to sharply bring down the cost of legal services.
